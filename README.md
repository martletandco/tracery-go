# tracery-go
An (currently incomplete) implementation of the [Tracery](http://tracery.io/) text-expansion library by [GalaxyKate](http://www.galaxykate.com/)

## List of important features missing
- Load/save to/from JSON
- Parse errors
- Expand for grammar debugging
- Adding/removing modifiers
- CBDQ compatibility
- _(Probably many others that have escaped me just now)_

## List of less important but still missing features
- Convenience functions for serialising/deserialising rules
- A command line wrapper for ad-hock usage
